I use expo to build the app to save time and also to easily preview app on my mobile device

I also couldn't implement any filter because of the dataset I choose to use(I couldn't find any better one)

The app just fetches a bunch of jobs from a job graphql api which am fetching using apollo
The experience can definately be improved by adding a loading state while fetching jobs, styled the app better and even write cleaner code

The code is not bad but I would have definately done some things better, seperate more concerns, break the huge main component into smaller components and even more
